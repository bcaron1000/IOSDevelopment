		<string>With a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine boasting 217 horsepower, the rally-bred WRX surfaces in Japan, and later in Europe, and begins to develop a cult following despite being off limits in America. Soon thereafter, Subaru cranks up the output to 280 horses in creating the WRX Type R STi; again, we pine for it from afar. Instead, Americans must console themselves with the Impreza 2.5 RS, a mildly sportified version of the two-door coupe, decked out in WRX-emulating blue paint with gold wheels. Hey, itâ€™s a start.</string>
