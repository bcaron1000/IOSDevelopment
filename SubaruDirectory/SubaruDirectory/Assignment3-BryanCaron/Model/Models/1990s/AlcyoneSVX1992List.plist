		<string>Subaru’s second try at a sports coupe is an impressive effort, with styling by Giugiaro, a 230-hp horizontally opposed six, and all-wheel drive (a front-drive version is added later, in a price-cutting move). The unusual window-within-a-window design allows for larger side glass. Nonetheless, it’s not a vehicle—or a price point—people associate with Subaru, and the SVX is gone after less than five years.</string>
