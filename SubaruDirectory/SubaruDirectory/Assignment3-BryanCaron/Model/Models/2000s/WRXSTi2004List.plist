		<string>The new STi, now bristling with 300 horsepower, launches in the U.S. market just days after its doppelg√§nger, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, and just like that, a new class of performance hero is born. It is a class with wild body addenda, highly boosted four-cylinder engines, and all-wheel drive. Notice we said nothing about sultry sheetmetal. The STi is the poster child for function over form.</string>
