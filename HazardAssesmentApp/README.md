This is my app, its a safety hazard assesment app, I came up with the idea when my day job boss was complaining that there wasnt something readily accessible. 
I included a scroll on the first page, but also had an issue with my constraints for the scroll view on the first page, and I discovered that on my 
second page(completed View) having 30+ labels on one page overlaying an image is ridiculously hard to make constraints work properly. I tried for at least 8- 9 hours 
to make it work in both portrait and landscape. and just ended up frustrating myself. It was a great learning experience, and I now know to not do an app that 
contains so many labels.
